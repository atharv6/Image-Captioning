# Image Captioning
Automatically Generating Captions for Images
##  Overview
In this Project we have to combine Deep Convolutional Nets for image classification  with Recurrent Networks for sequence modeling, to create a single network that generates descriptions of image using [COCO Dataset - Common Objects in Context](http://cocodataset.org/).

COCO is a large image dataset designed for object detection, segmentation, person keypoints detection, stuff segmentation, and caption generation. GPU Accelerated Computing (CUDA) is neccessery for this project.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as a series of Jupyter notebooks that are designed to be completed in sequential order:

__Notebook 0__ : Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset;

__Notebook 1__ : Load and pre-process data from the COCO dataset;

__Notebook 2__ : Training the CNN-RNN Model;

__Notebook 3__ : Load trained model and generate predictions.
